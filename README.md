# Shield SCSS

Shield is a little library with the files that I use on my job/projects

## Notes (for me when developing this thing and for who wanna use this)

1. Functions are written in camelCase, variables and mixins in lower-case separated by -
1. Variables are stored inisde of `functions/*.scss`, each file has your variables that will be used by the whole lib
1. It isn't a framework, it is a library for helping me/you creating things with SASS/SCSS - I prefer SCSS but of course you can use with SASS. 

## Documentation

## Helpers
Some of them aren't exactly helpers, just a camelCase for native SASS functions(i.e map-get() is just get())

## Problems, issues, questions...

Whatever, just open an [issue](https://github.com/mhernandes/shield-scss/issues) and let's talk bro.

## Why do not I store all of the variables in a separate file?

Just because having to open another file and keep looking at him just for check variables and maps are painful. It is easier just edit one file.
